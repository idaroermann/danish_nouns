Master Thesis Project

At this point, you only find a key that links two data sets. 
The page of the thesis work will soon be updated. 

A manually created key between SemDaX dictionary sense labels and DanNet synset id's was necessary for the approach of my thesis.
The key is created based on the available definition and sample sentences in both resources.

In this project you find a jupyter notebook with a key for each sense, together with comments.
